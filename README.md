In this project I have designed an application to generate a secure random password that adheres to some constraints.

## Features

* You're able to click the 'generate password with popups' button to be prompted with a series of popups asking your password parameters
* Clicking the 'Generate Password' button will take input from the togglable swithes on the page to generate a password
* The 'Copy to Clipboard' button will copy the generated password to the clipboard
* The switch in the top left corner will toggle a dark mode on and off
* Layout is responsive so that it looks consistent across all screen sizes
* Password output characters are coloured by type (letter, number or symbol) for easier reading

#### Features added after submission deadline:

* Added switch that will generate a bad password (if one would so desire)
* Password is now animated on display
