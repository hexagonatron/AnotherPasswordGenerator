* The 'Copy to Clipboard' button will copy the generated password to the clipboard
* The switch in the top left corner will toggle a dark mode on and off
* Layout is responsive so that it looks consistent across all screen sizes
* Password output characters are coloured by type (letter, number or symbol) for easier reading
